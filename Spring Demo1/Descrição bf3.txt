In my opinion, there's no need to have a clustered HUD in this game. Most of the things are already shown by the level design/game design. So why, in 2020, the Battlefield series doesnt already have a modular HUD?

Things they could implement
- The game could show the objectives by pressing TAB
- You still need subtitle to hear other languages translations
- A option to disable QTE or to show them
- Enable MENU

Things the game already does
- The characters already guide you through the stage.
- The level design shows you the right way
